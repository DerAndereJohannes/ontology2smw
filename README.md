# Ontology to SMW
_**Automating an RDF ontology import into Semantic Mediawiki**_

[Semantic Mediawiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org)(SMW) allows 
[external ontologies to be imported into a Mediawiki (MW) instance](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Import_vocabulary). 
external ontology's properties and classes can be used inside the MW instance, and produce a RDF exports of 
the wiki pages, which point to IRIs of the imported ontology(s).

The process of importing is simple, but time consuming. Hence making it a perfect candidate for an automated process, 
which can be run at anytime a new version of the ontology is published, hence this python script.

<s>Currently the script works only with [The Academic Event Ontology (AEON)](https://github.com/tibonto/aeon) in the context of the confIDent project,
but seems possible to make it work with any ontology and an instances of SMW. </s>

**In order for the terms of an ontology to be imported to SMW instance they should include the property
`aeon:SMW_datatype` and the appropriate [SMW datatype](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:List_of_datatypes) or Category for Classes**


<!-- HOW IS THE IMPORT DONE -->
## Install:

### Manually
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TIBHannover/ontology2smw.git
cd ontology2smw
# (optional) create and activate a virtual-environment
python setup.py install
```

## Run:

**Run:**

Using local ontology:<br/>`ontology2smw --format ttl --ontology aeon/aeon.ttl`

Using a remote ontology:<br/>`ontology2smw --format ttl --ontology https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tibonto/aeon/master/aeon.ttl`

Writing to wiki pages:<br/>`ontology2smw --format ttl --ontology aeon/aeon.ttl --write` 

Asking for help:<br/>`ontology2smw --help`
```bash
usage: ontology2smw [-h] [-w] [-o ONTOLOGY] [-f {application/rdf+xml,ttl}]

                   ___    
                 { . . } 
--------------o00---'----00o--
confIDent ontology2SMW  
-----------------------------

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w, --write           writes the output to wiki or file. Default: False (dry-run).
  -o ONTOLOGY, --ontology ONTOLOGY
                        Ontology file or URI
  -f {application/rdf+xml,ttl}, --format {application/rdf+xml,ttl}
                        Ontology format. Default value: application/rdf+xml
```

<!--

**Requirements:** 

In virtual environment install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python setup.py install`


**Create a build:** 

`python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
-->

### To write wiki pages
**wikidetails.yml & wiki write access**
* Ensure user your wiki user account belongs to bot group: see wiki page `Special:UserRights`
* Create a bot password in wiki page: `Special:BotPasswords`
* copy `wikidetails.template.yml` as `wikidetails.yml` and fill in bot name and password:<br/>
    
## Develop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TIBHannover/ontology2smw.git
cd ontology2smw
# (optional) create and activate a virtual-environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ontology2smw
```
    
    
## Properties from other ontologies
...

## queries with [ARQ](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/)
`arq --data=aeon/aeon.ttl   --query=ontology2smw/queries/ontology.rq`

`arq --data=aeon/aeon.ttl   --query=ontology2smw/queries/query_classes.rq`

`arq --data=aeon/aeon.ttl   --query=ontology2smw/queries/query_properties.rq`


# Other Scripts
## confident2wikidata_mapping.py
Script to make a YAML file that holds the mapping of AEON/ConfIDent properties to Wikidata properties, 
by parsing the annotation properties aeon:WikidataLabel and aeon:WikidatURI from the recent ontology TTL.

    :param  source          The URL of the recent aeon ontology (defaults to AEON/ConfIDent branch)
    :param  outfile_path     The file path of the YAML generated by the script
